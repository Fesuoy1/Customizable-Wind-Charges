### I have lost interest in developing mods for minecraft as i don't find them fun anymore, I may update/port this to future versions but that's highly unlikely. I recommend updating this yourselves by forking this repository.

Modrinth page: https://modrinth.com/mod/customizable-wind-charges

## Want more control over wind charges?
This mod adds a few gamerules that should make wind charges more useful/customizable.

## Gamerules Implemented
- /gamerule windChargeCooldown [number, defaulted to 10]
- /gamerule windChargePower [number, defaulted to 1]
- /gamerule windChargeKnockback [number, defaulted to 1]

##

## Note that this also affects breeze's wind charges.
~~I am planning to try separating this to another few gamerules.~~ scrapped temporarily due to to some issues i ran into. I may try to implement this again when 1.21 releases!
