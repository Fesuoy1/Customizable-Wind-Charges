Took a break from updating this mod for a few weeks. I may come back later.

## Want more control over wind charges?
This mod adds a few gamerules that should make wind charges more useful/customizable.

## Gamerules Implemented
- /gamerule windChargeCooldown [number, defaulted to 10]
- /gamerule windChargePower [number, defaulted to 1]
- /gamerule windChargeKnockback [number, defaulted to 1]

##

## Note that this also affects breeze's wind charges.
~~I am planning to try separating this to another few gamerules.~~ scrapped temporarily due to to some issues i ran into. I may try to implement this again when 1.21 releases!
